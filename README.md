# Unpredictability of the fitness effects of antimicrobial resistance mutations across environments in *Escherichia coli*

This repository contains the code and data required to reproduce the figures in the article [Unpredictability of the fitness effects of antimicrobial resistance mutations across environments in *Escherichia coli*](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msae086) by [Aaron Hinz](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4438-7043), [André Amado](https://andreamado.github.io/me/), [Rees Kassen](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5617-4259), [Claudia Bank](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4730-758X) and [Alex Wong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6zoyOd8AAAAJ). For details, please read our [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msae086).

The repository contains two types of figures:
- R figures - each figure in an individual folder bundled with the data necessary to generate them
- Python figures - each figure in an individual Python file with the data contained in the data/ and model_fit_data/ folders

The R code was written by Aaron Hinz and the Python code by André Amado.
